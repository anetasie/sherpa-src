		      Sherpa 4.5.0 Release Notes

			    12/13/2012 SAO

This document contains release notes for the Sherpa 4.5.0 release,
December 2012.  This distribution of Sherpa releases the code as a
standalone Python package.

The following features have been added since the release of Sherpa 4.4.0:


Features:
=========


  o A new IPython profile has been added, for use with IPython 0.13.

  o Many updates for dynamic grouping functions have been added.
    These include:

    - Fixes to retain filters after dynamic grouping, and after
      calling the group() and ungroup() functions.

    - A new rule, that when a dynamic grouping scheme is applied to a
      data set, it is also automatically applied to all associated
      background data sets.  Commands such as:

      group_snr(3)

      now apply this grouping condition to both source and background.
      It is no longer necessary to manually group the background(s).
      The filter is also correctly updated for both source and
      background.

      The user can still set different background grouping schemes.
      As an example,

      group_snr(3)
      group_snr(5, bkg_id=1)

      will first group both source and background data sets with 
      SNR >= 3, and then group the background only with SNR >= 5;

    - Filters can now be defined in channels, when working in channel
      space, whether the data are grouped or ungrouped.

  o The Sersic2d model has been added.  This model is a generalization
    of the de Vaucouleurs profile (i.e., the exponent is allowed to be
    values other than 4).

  o A new function, sample_flux(), has been added to calculate the
    unabsorbed energy flux due to a Sherpa model.  It returns a sample
    of parameters with a corresponding flux and a flux uncertainty for
    a model component or a combination of model components.  The model
    components have to be previously defined and used in the fit.  The
    samples are generated from the multi-variate normal distributions
    with the scales defined by covariance (if at the best fit) or
    supplied (as "scales").  The flux is calculated for each set of
    new parameters.  The returned flux value is given by a sample's
    median with the lower and upper quantiles defined by the
    confidence level supplied to the function.

  o To simulate X-ray spectra, the function fake_pha() has been
    updated to include background counts at the user's discretion.  If
    the user chooses to include background counts that had been read
    in with a previous PHA file, then the background counts are
    appropriately scaled, a Poisson draw is taken of the scaled
    background counts, and then that is added to the simulated source
    counts.  (If there are multiple backgrounds, then the average of
    the backgrounds is added to the simulated source counts.)

    The option can used called as shown here:

    load_pha("data.pha")
    set_source("xsphabs.a1 * xspowerlaw.p1")
    
    # To include background counts read in from data file 
    fake_pha(1,arf=get_arf(),rmf=get_rmf(),exposure=400000,bkg=get_bkg())

    # To include ONLY simulated source counts, no background added
    fake_pha(1,arf=get_arf(),rmf=get_rmf(),exposure=400000)

  o The following functions for XSPEC convolution models
    are now accessible through the Sherpa XSPEC module:

      C_cflux
      C_xsgsmt
      C_ireflct
      C_kdblur
      C_kdblur2
      C_spinconv
      C_xslsmt
      C_PartialCovering
      C_rdblur
      C_reflct
      C_simpl
      C_zashift
      C_zmshift

    The convolution models are *not* being made available for fitting
    in Sherpa.  These XSPEC functions are being made available to
    support development of corresponding Sherpa models in a future
    release.

  o Several corrections were made to formulas in the following 
    sherpa.astro.optical models:

    AbsorptionEdge
    AbsorptionGaussian
    AbsorptionVoigt
    EmissionGaussian
    EmissionLorentz
    EmissionVoigt
    OpticalGaussian

    A misuse of NumPy slices led to incorrect results in these mdoels.
    Also, AbsorptionEdge was made a multiplicative model,
    AbsorptionVoigt updated to correctly scale FWHM in both Gaussian
    and Lorentzian input models, and the EmissionLorentz "kurt",
    EmissionVoigt "lg" and EmissionGaussian "skew" parameters are now
    frozen by default.

  o 12619 Re: RFE: flux errors
  o 12871 Re: CIAOBETA/CIAOX: notice command and background data

Caveats:
========


  o IPython 0.13 profiles are incompatible with the IPython 0.10
    profile packaged with Sherpa 4.4.0.

    Customizations to user IPython profiles must be rewritten to work
    with IPython 0.13.
